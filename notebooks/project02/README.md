Ml02 – Titanic Data Features

Author: Beth Spornitz
Date: October 27, 2025

Project Overview

This project explores and prepares the Titanic dataset from Seaborn for machine learning analysis. It demonstrates essential data preparation workflows including: data inspection and visualization, handling missing values, feature engineering and encoding, feature selection and justification, splitting data into training and test sets, and documentation and version control using Git and GitHub. The goal is to create a clean, fully numeric dataset ready for classification modeling to predict passenger survival.

⚙️ WORKFLOW 1. Set Up Machine
1. Verify You Have These Installed

VS Code (with Python, Pylance, Jupyter, and Ruff extensions)

Git

uv – the environment and dependency manager

⚙️ WORKFLOW 2. Set Up Project

Once your environment is ready, follow these steps to set up your project.

Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/BethSpornitz/ml-bethspornitz

Create and Activate Your Virtual Environment: uv venv → uv python pin 3.12 → uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade → uv run pre-commit install → uv run python --version
Activate it: ..venv\Scripts\activate

⚙️ WORKFLOW 3. Daily Workflow

When working on the project, always start by opening the project folder in VS Code, not your global Repos folder.
3.1 Git Pull from GitHub: git pull
3.2 Run Checks as You Work: git pull → uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade → uv cache clean → git add . → uvx ruff check --fix → uvx pre-commit autoupdate → uv run pre-commit run --all-files → git add . → uv run pytest
💡 Run uv run pre-commit run --all-files twice if the first run fixes files automatically.
3.3 Build Project Documentation: uv run mkdocs build --strict → uv run mkdocs serve
3.4 Execute: Run your analysis notebook directly from VS Code using uv run jupyter notebook notebooks/project02/ml02_bethspornitz.ipynb

⚙️ WORKFLOW 4. Version Control

After making progress, save and push your work.
4.1 Git Add, Commit, and Push: git add . → git commit -m "Add Titanic project updates" → git push -u origin main

⚙️ WORKFLOW 5. Build Documentation

Your project automatically builds a professional documentation site using MkDocs whenever you push to GitHub. The site is built from the docs/ folder and configured by mkdocs.yml.

🧩 How the Project Works
Step 1: Load Data – Uses the Titanic dataset directly from Seaborn
Step 2: Explore – Inspect column types, missing values, and correlations
Step 3: Visualize – Scatter plots, histograms, and count plots
Step 4: Clean – Fill missing values using median and mode
Step 5: Engineer – Create family_size and encode categorical variables
Step 6: Split – Use both random and stratified train/test splits

📈 Example Output
Survivors: Percentage of passengers who survived (~38%)
Missing Values: Cleaned age and embark_town fields (0 remaining)
Engineered Features: family_size, encoded sex, embarked, and alone (verified)
Class Balance: Stratified split maintains survival ratios (balanced train/test sets)

Interpretation: Sex and passenger class are the strongest predictors of survival, consistent with historical reports. Stratified sampling preserves class proportions, ensuring fair model evaluation.
